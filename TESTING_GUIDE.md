```

### 2. Database Setup
```sql
-- Run the complete schema in Supabase SQL editor
-- File: DATABASE_SCHEMA.sql

-- Create test data
INSERT INTO guest_groups (group_name, max_guests) VALUES 
('Family', 10),
('Friends', 15),
('Work Colleagues', 8);

INSERT INTO guests (first_name, last_name, email, invitation_code, group_id, plus_one_allowed) VALUES 
('John', 'Smith', 'john@example.com', 'test123', (SELECT id FROM guest_groups WHERE group_name = 'Family'), true),
('Jane', 'Doe', 'jane@example.com', 'test456', (SELECT id FROM guest_groups WHERE group_name = 'Friends'), false);
